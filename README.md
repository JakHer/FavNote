## About

I started this course to get basic knowledge about React. I gathered knowledge and will try to keep it here as notes for essential React knowledge.

## What I have learned during app creation

- React (written on the 16.13.1 version) [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [JSX](#jsx)
- Virtual DOM

## My Notes from course

### jsx

JSX are basicly extension of JavaScript syntax with the possibility of inserting HTML tags.
Without JSX we would have to use React.createElement() method and pass:
element eg. `h1`
props eg. `className`
...children eg. `Hello World`
Horror!

## Setup

To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../fav-note
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### `npm start`
